## Known Issue
Due to an outage with the **"disease.sh"** API, some functionalities aren't fully operational at the moment.

### Temporary API Outage:

As of the latest update, I am experiencing a temporary outage with the "disease.sh" API, which is integral to fetching real-time data for our COVID Tracker application. Unfortunately, this unforeseen circumstance has hindered the completion of certain functionalities, notably within the CountryInfoItem feature.

### Impact:
-**CountryInfoItem Completion**: The outage has specifically affected the finalization of every aspect intended for the CountryInfoItem feature. Due to the unavailability of the API, essential data required for this component cannot be retrieved at the moment.

-**Frontend Polishing**: Additionally, the frontend enhancements and polishing that were planned to refine the user interface and improve overall user experience could not be executed due to the reliance on the API for essential data.
